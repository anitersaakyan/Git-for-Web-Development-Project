## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a language or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. 
3. Why do we create a branch? Creating a new branch allows you to isolate your changes from the master branch. If your experimentation goes well you always have the option to merge your changes into the master branch. If things don't go so well you can always discard the branch or keep it within your local repository.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git-checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 
git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository
git merge - Join two or more development histories together
git pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
7. What is a merge conflict? An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Developers work in separate isolated branches
